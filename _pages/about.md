I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science, where I am advised by Prof. Christina Christara. My research is in using sparse grids to overcome the curse of dimensionality in numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs).

My previous work has been on using neural networks to solve PDEs, on methods of testing and validating numerical software, on the efficient simulation of stiff ODEs, and on the implementation of simplex methods for linear programming and l1 regression.

I received my undergraduate degree (BSc Honours) in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by Prof. Uri Ascher.

I am fortunate and grateful to be funded/have been funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS) Program, and the Department of Computer Science throughout my studies.
